An app made in three days in order to fully understand how React works with Rails.
It is a minimum viable product but it works properly.

simple-game-collection is a Video Game backlog manager.
It uses the RAWG API to search games that you can seamlessly copy to your database and then put a status on them (Playing, Completed, Paused, In Backlog)

Ruby : 3.1.2
Rails : 7.0.4

Clone then Bundle install

Don't pay attention to the code, this is my first time with React
